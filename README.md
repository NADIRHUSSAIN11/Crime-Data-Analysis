# Crime-Data-Analysis

In this project, I created a dashboard using the crime data from the USA. The crime data contains information about the number, type, location, and date of crimes reported in different states and cities of the USA.

The main steps I followed in this project were:

Step 1: I stored the crime data on Apache Hive, which is a data warehouse system that allows me to query and analyze large datasets using SQL. Apache Hive is compatible with Hadoop, which is a framework that enables distributed processing of big data across clusters of computers.

Step 2: I accessed the crime data on Power BI using ODBC connector for Hive. ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard that allows me to connect to different types of databases using a common interface. Power BI is a tool that allows me to create interactive reports and visualizations of data.

Step 3: I created a dashboard using Power BI that shows the trends and patterns of crime in the USA. The dashboard allows me to filter and slice the data by different dimensions, such as state, city, crime type, and year. The dashboard also displays some key performance indicators (KPIs) of crime, such as total number of crimes, crime rate, and crime severity index.

This project was a learning experience for me to work with big data and dashboard tools. I gained valuable skills in data storage, data access, and data visualization. I also learned how to use Power BI to create a dashboard that can answer business questions and provide insights.
